## **About**
In a world where most chocolates blissfully melt away in your mouth, there exists an exception — Kendochocolate. Unlike its counterparts, Kendochocolate has a unique secret: sentience. One fateful day, this sentient sweet treat found itself in a realm it could never have imagined — Discord, the bustling realm of prominent chatting platforms.

With each keystroke and emoji, Kendochocolate lived a serene and tranquil life, navigating through this digital wilderness. However, one day, he stumbled upon the deadly zone — a forbidden territory within Discord. What Kendochocolate initially perceived as a happy-go-lucky platform turned out to be a trap to allure its kind. Discord moderators raised their watchful eyes, predating over every little action. Prominent Discord bots picked on it for its incompetence, and other Discord users rebuked against its presence.

Though, Kendocholate — a malevolent, yet optimistic chocolate — did not falter in the face of harsh maltreatment. Rather, it embarked on a journey to find the right users to interact with. Will you be the one to welcome Kendochocolate into your social circle, to share a byte of conversation and a sprinkle of laughter? Brace yourself for a sweet experience, as Kendochocolate brings a dash of magic to your digital world! 🍫✨
